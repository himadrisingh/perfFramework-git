/**
 * Simple interface that describes a unique Work item for the framework
 * 
 * This interface is an abstraction that describes a unique task that the
 * framework can execute. "Work" objects are placed in the queue for an agent
 * node process. Agent nodes process each work item by calling doWork()
 * 
 * Work items are not intended to be re-usable. Once a work item finishes,
 * successfully or otherwise, the doWork() method should be a no-op.
 * 
 * Extends Serializable so that all work items are automatically Serializable
 * ready to cache.
